## Title: 

Predicting the risk of food contamination using machine learning models

## Description:

Maintaining a continuously sufficient supply of safe food products is integral in sustaining life and promoting good health. According to the World Health Organization, the chemical and microbial contamination of food products was associated with more than 200 diseases with an estimated 420,000 death cases per year. The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) is responsible for the periodic safety assessment in the locally produced/marketed products and for minimizing the risk of contamination in those imported to the Saudi market. The risk mitigation plan for the imported food products is driven by the approach of sending high risk products by to the SFDA and private laboratories before they enter the market.  The selection of high risk products is based on a risk classification tool and based on the experience of the SFDA inspectors. To direct the risk determination approach towards more efficient (from a time and cost perspective) and accurate strategy, the SFDA Research Informatics Department is working on building machine learning (ML) models that help in predicting the risk of contamination in the imported products. The project was started by extracting datasets of the targeted predictors from the SFDA Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), and by a comprehensive data assessment phase. Then, preliminary MLs (e.g. KKN, decision tree, GBM) were trained and assessed by the team using different packages (e.g. Tidymodels suite) in RStudio. Several other product- and country specific models will be built and compared with the original MLs. This project (in addition to other ones) is part of an initiative to incorporate artificial intelligence into the regulatory framework of the SFDA.
